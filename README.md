# Problem Statement 6 : Building an E-commerce Microservices Application on Cloud using Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and Git
## Overview:
The aim of this project is to develop an e-commerce microservices application that can be deployed on the cloud using Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and Git. The application will consist of several microservices that will be deployed as Docker containers on a Kubernetes cluster. Jenkins will be used for continuous integration and deployment, while Git will be used for version control.
## Objectives:
* Design and implement the microservices architecture for the application.
* Create Docker containers for each microservice.
* Use Kubernetes to orchestrate the containers locally.
* Implement a Jenkins to automate the deployment process.
* Integrate Git with Jenkins to trigger the pipeline on code changes.
